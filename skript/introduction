Today, we will take a look at the so-called "Seven circles theorem".
While the statement of the theorem can be expressed in simple geometric terms,
the method we will use to prove it delves into seemingly unrelated concepts from hyperbolic geometry.
It involves a surprising change of perspective between [the???] euclidean and hyperbolic space.
On the way we will learn about two different models of hyperbolic space, how distances are measured
as well as circles and polygons in this hyperbolic setting.
Mind you, this is not the only way to prove our theorem.
The first proofs of the seven circle theorem in the 1970s did not wander through the lands of hyperbolic geometry
but used mainly euclidean methods.

Let us now finally take a look at the seven circle theorem.
