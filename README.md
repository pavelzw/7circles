# The Seven Circle Theorem

This repository contains the source code for a video about the proof of the Seven Circle Theorem by [Drach and Schwartz](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00161.pdf).

The video is uploaded to YouTube. The video is available in [English](https://youtu.be/m9v0h2ibYpo) and in [German](https://youtu.be/flR3e5Cc2G4).

## Theorem 
For every chain $H_1, \ldots, H_6$ of consequently touching circles inscribed in and touching the unit circle, the three main diagonals of the hexagon comprised of the points at which the chain touches the unit circle, intersect at a common point.
