00:00:00,748 --> 00:00:03,658
Today we are dealing with the Seven-Circle-Theorem.

2
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:06,820
The Seven-Circle-Theorem states the following:

3
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:12,328
Let C_0 be a circle and C_1, ..., C_6 circles contained in C_0, 

4
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:21,000
such that each inner circle is tangent to the outer circle

5
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:28,990
and any two adjacent inner circles are also tangent to each other. 

6
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:41,150
Then the three diagonals of the hexagon formed by the intersections of the inner circles with the outer circle meet

7
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,474
in one point.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,390
Our goal now is to prove this theorem.

9
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:05,940
We will be able to do this by embedding the problem in a Hyperbolic framework.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,960
First, we give a small introduction to Hyperbolic geometry 

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,115
in order to reformulate and further work on the problem with our newly gained knowledge.

12
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:22,110
Axiomatically, the Hyperbolic space differs from the Euclidean space

13
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,792
in that the parallel axiom does not hold.

14
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,260
The parallel axiom states

15
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,585
that for every straight line g and every point P that does not lie on g,

16
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:38,850
there is exactly one straight line h that runs through P and is parallel to g.

17
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:42,990
Parallel here simply means that the two straight lines do not intersect.

18
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:47,130
This property does not exist in Hyperbolic geometry.

19
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,460
There, for every such g and P there are several - even infinitely many - straight lines through P

20
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,610
which are parallel to g, i.e., do not intersect g.

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,220
However, our representation here is misleading,

22
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,110
because of course g will be intersected by all but the original line h

23
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,360
if we follow them long enough. 

24
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,620
In general, we have the problem that we want to

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,177
represent a Hyperbolic space in the Euclidean plane - this video.

26
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:18,270
So the question we are now addressing is:

27
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,870
How do you represent the Hyperbolic plane in the Euclidean space?

28
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,200
There are different models for the Hyperbolic plane.

29
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:33,060
Such models are simply mappings from the Hyperbolic to the Euclidean plane.

30
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,749
We take a closer look at the Poincaré and Klein models.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,260
First, let's take a closer look at the Poincaré model.

32
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,200
The representation of the hyperbolic plane in the

33
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,531
Poincaré model is limited to the unit disk.

34
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:57,185
The geodesics of the Poincaré model are - in contrast to straight lines in Euclidean -

35
00:02:57,185 --> 00:03:01,053
circle segments that intersect the unit circle at right angles.

36
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:05,044
This makes it clear that the parallel axiom does not apply here.

37
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,000
For a point P and a geodesic one finds any number of other geodesics that

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,282
intersect P but not the original geodesic.

39
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:18,260
Even if it seems so at first glance,

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,080
the hyperbolic plane is by no means limited.

41
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:24,620
If we let a point in the hyperbolic plane

42
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,560
move in one direction with constant speed,

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,760
we see that it never reaches the boundary of the Poincaré model.

44
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:39,612
The unit circle is at infinity and does not belong to the Poincaré model.

45
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:44,150
The following representation of the distortion is helpful for further understanding.

46
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:48,440
This is a tiling of the hyperbolic plane.

47
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,000
All these triangles have the same Hyperbolic shape and area.

48
00:03:55,078 --> 00:04:00,710
The Poincaré model thus provides a highly distorted representation of Hyperbolic space.

49
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,320
Now we consider the Klein model.

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,890
We will see strong similarities to the Poincaré model.

51
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:16,520
The biggest difference is that geodesics here actually correspond to Euclidean lines.

52
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,370
However, since these are limited by the unit circle, as in the Poincaré model,

53
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,100
the parallel axiom does not apply here either.

54
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:33,380
There is also a strong distortion of space in the Klein model.

55
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,030
Here, we see the same tiling of the Hyperbolic plane in the Klein model.

56
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,030
Towards the border, distances also become larger and larger here.

57
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,140
Since both models represent the same space,

58
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,050
it is obvious that there are mappings that identify the points of the models with each other.

59
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,820
In fact, they exist. We call them f and f^ -1.

60
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,381
As we see here, the formulas for these mappings are fairly simple.

61
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,220
With f and f^-1 we can now transfer objects from one model to the

62
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,684
other, especially geodesics.

63
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:33,370
Since the mappings act pointwise, intersections between geodesics are preserved.

64
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,930
This now gives us the following reformulation of the Seven-Circles-Theorem.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,123
Let C_0 be a circle and C_1 to C_6 ​​circles contained in C_0 such

66
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:58,447
that each inner circle is tangent to the outer circle

67
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:04,730
and any two adjacent inner circles are also tangent to each other. 

68
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,900
Then the three hyperbolic diagonals of the hyperbolic hexagon 

69
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,370
formed by the intersections of the inner circles with the outer circle meet

70
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:25,724
in one point.

71
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,400
When we have proved this theorem,

72
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,390
we simply apply the transformation from the Poincaré to the Klein model

73
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,690
and have thus also proved the original theorem.

74
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:49,001
Now we introduce some new concepts in the Hyperbolic space.

75
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:51,670
Let's take a closer look at the behavior of circles and

76
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,860
radii in hyperbolic space.

77
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,610
To do this, we compare it to the Euclidean circles we are familiar with.

78
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,580
A circle consists of all points that

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,700
are the same distance from their center P.

80
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,230
In Euclidean, of course, we measure distance with the Euclidean distance function.

81
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,980
Hyperbolic discs, which we embed in the Poincaré model,

82
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,650
are defined exactly like Euclidean circles,

83
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,670
except here we use a different distance function to measure lengths.

84
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,770
At the center of the Poincaré disk, the hyperbolic circles look the

85
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,450
same as the Euclidean ones.

86
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,700
If we now change the center,

87
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,320
the shape of the hyperbolic circles still corresponds to that of the Euclidean circles,

88
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,680
but the center of the Euclidean circles no longer

89
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,900
corresponds to that of the hyperbolic ones.

90
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,350
Let's take a closer look at the hyperbolic radius.

91
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,800
This is measured using the hyperbolic distance function,

92
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,860
which measures the distance between two points b and c

93
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,020
in the hyperbolic plane.

94
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,780
For the calculation we still need the intersection points

95
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,780
of the geodesic with the edge of the unit disc.

96
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,330
We call these points a and d.

97
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,540
To evaluate the hyperbolic distance function, we

98
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:16,305
interpret points a through d as points in the complex number plane.

99
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:18,250
Although it doesn't seem like it to us,

100
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,531
the hyperbolic circle is at every point the same distance from its center.

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,100
If we move the hyperbolic center to the edge

102
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,250
and look at the associated concentric circles,

103
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,580
the hyperbolic radius converges to infinity

104
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,520
and we get so-called horodisks.

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,200
Having got a feel for circles in hyperbolic space,

106
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,540
we now look at hyperbolic hexagons in

107
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,720
order to then be able to define the alternating perimeter,

108
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,960
which is of great importance to our main theorem.

109
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,900
A hyperbolic polygon is defined as in Euclidean,

110
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,540
but the curves connecting the vertices are

111
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,320
not straight lines, but segments of a circle, as is always the case in the Poincaré model.

112
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,280
The corners of the polygon can be anywhere in the hyperbolic plane.

113
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,730
If the vertices all lie on the edge of the Poincaré disk,

114
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,673
we call our polygon ideal.

115
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:21,414
As in Euclidean, 

116
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:26,170
the perimeter of a hyperbolic polygon can be defined as the sum of the side lengths.

117
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,370
Note that we are measuring the hyperbolic distance of the vertices.

118
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,000
In the case of hexagons, an even number of corners can

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,850
also be used to define an alternating perimeter.

120
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,980
Instead of taking the sum of all side lengths, we now calculate the alternating sum,

121
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,904
i.e., subtract every other length.

122
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,070
So now let's look at the alternating perimeter of an ideal hexagon.

123
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,030
The problem here is that the individual segments S_k

124
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,000
have infinite length because they touch the border.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,840
So we cannot calculate the alternating perimeter directly.

126
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,143
However, geodesic segments that do not touch the boundary have finite length.

127
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:11,053
We can take advantage of this in the following.

128
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:14,510
We trace the alternating perimeter of an ideal hexagon

129
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,485
to that of a non-ideal hexagon.

130
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,240
Since its edges have finite length, we can explicitly calculate the alternating perimeter here. 

131
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:30,230
To do this, consider a sequence P_n of hyperbolic non-ideal hexagons 

132
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,568
that converge to an ideal hexagon P_∞.

133
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:42,440
We now put a disk D_i at each vertex of P_n

134
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,960
so that consecutive disks do not overlap.

135
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,949
Further we define S_k^~ as the edge to the borders of the disks.

136
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,800
We see that the lengths of the S_k^~ are finite.

137
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,940
If we change the radius of a disc,

138
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,660
we add and subtract the same amount on both sides,

139
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,120
in this case for S_1 and S_6.

140
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:14,060
So the alternating perimeter is independent of the size of our disks,

141
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,210
even if our disks have zero radius.

142
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,583
It follows that the alternating sum of S_k is equal to the alternating sum of S_k^~.

143
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:26,510
If we let n go towards infinity,

144
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,580
this relationship still applies.

145
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,730
But since the lengths S_k^~ are now finite,

146
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,350
we have actually found a meaningful calculation for the alternating circumference.

147
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,435
Now let's consider an ideal hexagon.

148
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:49,940
If we connect the opposite sides of this hexagon,

149
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,180
we see that a triangle is formed in the middle.

150
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,812
Let's call this triangle T_P.

151
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,330
We now show the following theorem:

152
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,030
For any ideal hexagon,

153
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,210
the alternating perimeter is exactly

154
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,730
twice the perimeter of T_P, except for the sign.

155
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,600
For the proof we first define the notion of a semi-ideal triangle.

156
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,470
It has two corners on the edge of the circle - that is, ideal points -

157
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,016
plus one corner in the hyperbolic plane.

158
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:43,860
In our ideal hexagon there are three such triangles: Y_1, Y_2 and Y_3.

159
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,640
There are also

160
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,590
three more semi-ideal triangles on the respective opposite sides,

161
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,020
which intersect the inner triangle T_P.

162
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,144
We call them G_1, G_2 and G_3.

163
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:08,444
We define a quantity similar to the alternating perimeter for hyperbolic triangles.

164
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:13,170
If we remove disjoint horodisks from the two ideal nodes of the triangle,

165
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,000
we get lengths L_1', L_2' and L_3'.

166
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:24,210
We use this to define the alternating perimeter of a semi-ideal triangle

167
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,000
by adding the two blue lengths

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,290
and subtracting the red one.

169
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,910
The alternating perimeter does not depend on the size of each circle,

170
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,180
since the same length is both added to and subtracted from it.

171
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,520
The triangles G_k and Y_k each share exactly one node for k=1, ..., 3.

172
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,990
In each case there is an isometry I_k that

173
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,110
maps the opposite triangles to each other.

174
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,890
We can construct this as follows:

175
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:10,110
With the help of so-called Möbius transformations - isometries in the hyperbolic plane -

176
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,710
we can map the intersection of the two triangles to the origin.

177
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:20,070
The two diagonals that intersect the point are now both straight lines through the origin.

178
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:24,600
Therefore, we can simply do a point reflection at the origin,

179
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,750
transforming the right triangle onto the left.

180
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,210
Of course, the whole thing works not only for the first pair of triangles,

181
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,290
but for all of them.

182
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,230
Since we have an isometry between the two triangles,

183
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,930
the alternating perimeters of the triangles are the same.

184
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:53,590
We can write these formulas explicitly for all three pairs of triangles

185
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,400
and bring the perimeter of G_k to the other side.

186
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,090
Now we can add everything together and get the following formula.

187
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,700
What does this sum actually mean now?

188
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,921
Let's look at the whole picture.

189
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,940
If we subtract the perimeter of the G_i,

190
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,292
a part with the perimeter of the Y_i cancels out.

191
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,820
We see that we have summed twice

192
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,450
the perimeter of the inner triangle as well as the alternating perimeter of the hexagon.

193
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,132
Overall, our assertion follows.

194
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,230
Now we are finally ready to prove the Seven-Circles-Theorem.

195
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,830
Let's look here for a Hyperbolic hexagon with circles

196
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,110
tangent to the large circle,

197
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,410
with adjacent circles touching at exactly one point.

198
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,200
If we now look at the alternating perimeter of this hexagon,

199
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,660
we see that it is exactly zero since the individual pieces in the circles cancel out.

200
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,850
And that's exactly the perimeter of the triangle in the middle

201
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,760
by the theorem we just proved.

202
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:51,220
So the main diagonals of the hexagon meet at one point.

203
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,500
Now we only have to perform the transformation from the Poincaré model to the Klein model.

204
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:01,390
The statement also applies here because the intersection points of the diagonals

205
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,280
continue to run through a point.

206
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,330
This corresponds exactly to the scenario from the original Seven Circles Theorem,

207
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,040
which we have thus proved.
