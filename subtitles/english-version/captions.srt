00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,200
Today, we will take a look at the 
so-called “Seven circles theorem”.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,240
While the statement of the theorem can 
be expressed in simple geometric terms,

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,960
the method we will use to prove it delves into  

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,920
seemingly unrelated concepts 
from hyperbolic geometry.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,080
It involves a surprising change of perspective 
between Euclidean and hyperbolic space.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,040
On the way we will learn about two 
different models of hyperbolic space,

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,480
how distances are measured

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,080
as well as circles and polygons 
in this hyperbolic setting.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,360
Mind you, this is not the 
only way to prove our theorem.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,080
The first proofs of the seven circles theorem 

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,240
in the 1970s did not wander through 
the lands of hyperbolic geometry

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,080
but used mainly euclidean methods.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,840
Let us now finally take a look 
at the seven circles theorem.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,920
Let C be a circle containing six smaller circles,  

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,240
such that each inner circle 
is tangent to the outer circle

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:25,840
and any two adjacent inner circles 
are also tangent to each other.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,480
Let us also draw the hexagon formed by the 
intersection points of each inner circle  

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
with the outer circle.

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,120
The Seven Circles Theorem then states that 
the three main diagonals of the hexagon  

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
will always meet at a single point.

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,480
Our goal is to now prove this statement.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,600
We will be able to do this by embedding 
the problem into a hyperbolic framework.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,080
First, we give a small 
introduction to hyperbolic geometry

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,840
to then rephrase the problem 
in this setting with our newly gained knowledge.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,040
Axiomatically, hyperbolic space 
differs from Euclidean space  

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
in that the parallel axiom does not hold.

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,800
The parallel axiom states that for every straight 
line g and every point P that does not lie on g,

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
there is exactly one straight line h 
that runs through P and is parallel to g.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,600
By “parallel” we only mean 
that they do not intersect.

30
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,000
This property does not hold in hyperbolic space.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Here, for every line g and point P there 
are several — even infinitely many —

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,320
straight lines through P which are parallel 
to g, meaning they do not intersect g.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
However, our representation here is misleading.

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Of course, g will be intersected 
by all but the original line h

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
if we follow them long enough.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Generally, we have the problem that 
we want to represent hyperbolic space  

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,040
in the Euclidean plane, namely this video.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
So the question we are addressing now is:

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,760
How can we represent the 
hyperbolic in the Euclidean plane?

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
There are different models 
for the hyperbolic plane.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,240
Such models simply map the 
hyperbolic to the Euclidean plane.

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
We take a closer look at the 
Poincaré and Klein models.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,680
There are however multiple other models 
which can be helpful in other contexts.

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,160
First, let's take a closer 
look at the Poincaré model.

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,520
The representation of the hyperbolic plane in 
the Poincaré model is limited to the unit disk.

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,680
The geodesics of the Poincaré model are — 
unlike straight lines in Euclidean space —

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,520
circle segments that intersect 
the unit circle at a right angle.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
This illustrates why the parallel 
axiom does not apply here:

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,880
For a point P and a geodesic 
g, we can find arbitrarily many  

50
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,160
other geodesics that intersect P but not g.

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,080
Even if it appears that way at first glance, 
the hyperbolic plane is by no means limited.

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
If we let a point move in one 
direction with constant speed,

53
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,320
we notice that it never reaches 
the boundary of the Poincaré model.

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,680
The unit circle itself does not belong to 
the Poincaré model and can not be reached.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
This distortion can be visualized by 
looking at a tiling of the hyperbolic plane.

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
All these triangles have the 
same hyperbolic shape and area.

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:55,840
The Poincaré model thus provides a highly 
distorted representation of hyperbolic space.

58
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
Now, let us consider the Klein model.

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
We will see strong similarities 
to the Poincaré model.

60
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,240
The biggest difference is that geodesics 
here actually correspond to Euclidean lines.

61
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
As in the Poincaré model, we 
are limited by the unit circle.

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,600
Thus, the parallel axiom 
does not apply here either.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,840
The Klein model also gives a very distorted 
represenation of hyperbolic space.

64
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Here, we see the same tiling as 
before, now in the Klein model.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
Distances become larger and 
larger towards the border,  

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,840
making the triangles seem 
smaller, the closer we get to it.

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Since both models represent the same space, 
it is natural that there are mappings

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
that identify the points of 
the models with each other.

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
We call them f and f^-1.

70
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
As we see here, the formulas for 
these maps are fairly simple.

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,960
With f and f^-1, we can now transfer objects from 
one model to the other, specifically geodesics.

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,840
Since the maps act pointwise, intersections 
between geodesics are preserved.

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,600
This helps us rephrase the Seven Circles Theorem:

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,200
Let C be a circle containing six smaller circles,  

75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,320
such that each inner circle 
is tangent to the outer circle

76
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,160
and any two adjacent inner circles 
are also tangent to each other.

77
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,920
Drawing the hyperbolic hexagon 
formed by the intersection points  

78
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,840
of each inner circle with the outer circle,

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:15,840
the three main diagonals will 
always meet at a single point.

80
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
After having proven this new statement,

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,800
we simply apply the transformation 
from the Poincaré to the Klein model  

82
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,840
and have thus also proven the original theorem.

83
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
Now we introduce some new 
concepts in hyperbolic space.

84
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,160
Let's take a closer look at the behavior 
of circles and their radii in this setting.

85
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,800
To do this, we compare it to Euclidean 
circles we are familiar with.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,160
A circle consists of all points that are 
the same distance from their center P.

87
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,160
In Euclidean space, we measure distance 
with the Euclidean distance function.

88
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,280
Hyperbolic disks, which we embed in the Poincaré 
model, are defined exactly like Euclidean circles.

89
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,840
Except here, we use a different 
distance function to measure lengths.

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,000
At the center of the Poincaré disk, the hyperbolic 
circles look the same as the Euclidean ones.

91
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,640
If we now change the center,  

92
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,080
the shape of the hyperbolic circles still 
corresponds to that of the Euclidean circles,

93
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,200
but the center of the Euclidean circles no longer 
corresponds to that of the hyperbolic ones.

94
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Let's take a closer look at the hyperbolic radius.

95
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,840
It is defined using the 
hyperbolic distance function,

96
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,800
which measures the distance between two 
points b and c in the hyperbolic plane.

97
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,840
For the calculation, we need the 
intersection points of the geodesic  

98
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,440
with the border of the unit disk.

99
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
We call these points a and d.

100
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
To evaluate the hyperbolic distance function,  

101
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
we interpret points a through d 
as numbers in the complex plane.

102
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
It might not look like it,  

103
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,960
but the hyperbolic circle has the same 
distance to its center at every point.

104
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,480
If we move the hyperbolic center to the border 
and look at the associated concentric circles,

105
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,480
the hyperbolic radius converges to 
infinity and we get so-called horodisks.

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
After obtaining an intuition 
for circles in hyperbolic space,  

107
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
we now want to also understand 
hyperbolic hexagons.

108
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
From there on, we will be able to 
define the alternating perimeter,  

109
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,400
which is of great importance to our main theorem.

110
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,040
A hyperbolic polygon is 
defined as in Euclidean space.

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,520
However, we will represent the 
curves connecting the vertices  

112
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,960
as circle segments, as 
always in the Poincaré model.

113
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,840
The corners of the polygon can be 
anywhere in the hyperbolic plane.

114
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,320
If the vertices all lie on the border of the 
Poincaré disk, we call our polygon ideal.

115
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
As in the Euclidean case,  

116
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,000
the perimeter of a hyperbolic polygon can 
be defined as the sum of the sidelengths.

117
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,840
Note that we are measuring the 
hyperbolic distance between the vertices.

118
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,080
In the case of hexagons, an even number of corners 
can be used to define an alternating perimeter.

119
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,200
Instead of taking the sum of all sidelengths,  

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,080
we now calculate the alternating sum, 
i.e., subtract every other length.

121
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,000
So now let's look at the alternating 
perimeter of an ideal hexagon.

122
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,280
The problem here is that 
the individual segments S_k  

123
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,760
have infinite length since they touch the border.

124
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,120
Therefore, we cannot calculate the 
alternating perimeter directly.

125
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,120
However, geodesic segments that do not 
touch the boundary have finite length.

126
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,280
We will take advantage of this.

127
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,240
We define the alternating perimeter of an ideal 
hexagon using that of a non-ideal hexagon.

128
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
Since its edges have finite length,  

129
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,880
we can explicitly calculate 
the alternating perimeter here.

130
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
To do this, consider a sequence P_n 
of hyperbolic non-ideal hexagons  

131
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
that converge to an ideal hexagon P_∞.

132
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,240
We now put a disk at each vertex of P_n 
so that consecutive disks do not overlap.

133
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,480
Further we define S_k^~ as the length of 
the edge between the borders of the disks.

134
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,920
Obviously, these S_k^~ are finite.

135
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
If we change the radius of 
a disk, we add and subtract  

136
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
the same amount from the alternating perimeter.

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,000
In this case S_1^~ and S_6^~ are changed.

138
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,840
Therefore, the alternating perimeter is 
independent of the size of our disks,  

139
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,960
in particular when our disks have radius zero.

140
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,120
Thus, the alternating sum of S_k is 
equal to the alternating sum of S_k^~.

141
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,320
If we let n go towards infinity, 
this equality still holds.

142
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,640
But since the lengths S_k^~ are now finite,  

143
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,880
we have actually found a meaningful 
calculation for the alternating perimeter.

144
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,520
Now let's consider an ideal hexagon.

145
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,640
If we connect the opposite sides of this 
hexagon, a triangle appears in the middle.

146
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,840
Let's call this triangle T_P.

147
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
We now prove the following equality:

148
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,960
For any ideal hexagon, the absolute 
value of the alternating perimeter  

149
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,760
is exactly twice the perimeter of T_P.

150
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,320
For the proof we first define the 
notion of a semi-ideal triangle.

151
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,080
It has two corners on the 
boundary of the circle, i.e., ideal points,

152
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,600
and one corner 
in the hyperbolic plane.

153
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,440
In our ideal hexagon, there are three 
such triangles: Y_1, Y_2 and Y_3.

154
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,680
Three other semi-ideal triangles 
which intersect the inner triangle T_P  

155
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
can be found opposite to the Y_k triangles.

156
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,120
We call them G_1, G_2 and G_3.

157
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,840
For hyperbolic triangles, we define a notion 
similar to the alternating perimeter.

158
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,400
If we add disjoint horodisks at the 
two ideal vertices of the triangle,  

159
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,440
we get lengths L_1', L_2' and L_3'.

160
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,120
We use this to define the alternating perimeter  

161
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,720
of a semi-ideal triangle by adding the two 
blue lengths and subtracting the red one.

162
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,760
The alternating perimeter does not 
depend on the size of each circle,  

163
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,840
since the same length is 
both added and subtracted.

164
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,240
The triangles G_k and Y_k each share 
exactly one vertex for k = 1, 2 and 3.

165
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,640
In each case, there is an isometry I_k that 
maps opposite triangles onto each other.

166
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,240
We can construct these isometries as follows:

167
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,520
With the help of so-called Möbius transformations 
— isometries in the hyperbolic plane —

168
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,280
we can map the intersection of 
the two triangles to the origin.

169
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,200
The two diagonals that intersect the point are 
now both straight lines through the origin.

170
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,840
Therefore, we can simply perform 
a point reflection at the origin,  

171
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,880
transforming one triangle onto the other.

172
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Of course, the whole thing works not 
only for the first pair of triangles,  

173
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,840
but for all three of them.

174
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,520
Since we have an isometry 
between the two triangles,  

175
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,920
their alternating perimeter is the same.

176
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,840
We can write these formulas explicitly for all 
three pairs of triangles and bring the perimeter  

177
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,520
of G_k to the other
side.

178
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
By adding everything together, 
we obtain the following formula.

179
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,840
But what does this sum actually represent?

180
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:07,840
Let's look at the sum in the picture.

181
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
If we subtract the alternating 
perimeter of the G_i,

182
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,880
a part of the sum cancels out with 
the alternating perimeter of the Y_i.

183
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,920
We notice that we obtain twice the 
perimeter of the inner triangle  

184
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,040
as well as the alternating 
perimeter of the hexagon.

185
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Overall, our equality follows.

186
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Now we are finally ready to 
prove the Seven Circles Theorem.

187
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,200
Let's look at an ideal hyperbolic hexagon 
with circles tangent to the large circle

188
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,480
such that adjacent circles 
touch at a single point.

189
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
Taking a look at the alternating 
perimeter of this hexagon,  

190
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
we notice that the hexagon 
segments in the circles cancel out.

191
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,320
Therefore, the alternating perimeter is zero.

192
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,000
So the perimeter of the triangle in the middle 
is also zero, using the equality we just proved.

193
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,880
Thus, the main diagonals of the 
hexagon must meet at a single point.

194
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,760
All that's left is to perform the transformation 
from the Poincaré model back to the Klein model.

195
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,680
As mentioned before, the diagonals 
continue to run through a single point.

196
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,840
This corresponds exactly to the scenario 
from the original Seven Circles Theorem 

197
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,840
which we have thus proved.
